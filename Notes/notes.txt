for land grant stuff
have map of event on the page
be able to check the ballance of accounts to see if they have enough to pay their due
add withdraw function so that the land steward can withdraw the amount from their account with the note that its for land grant

add a lock so that only people that are part of a land grant can register for volunteering shifts

use the land grand tab of charter table to turn this on and off. have one that has a null set for part tab if that one has land grant true then allow everyone to register for volunteering shifts

use question tab of users table to track if someone is part of a land grant to allow for less database pings


the land steward will use the charter table part tab to track who is part of a land grant. If they say to add a ship to a particular land grant it will add the entire crew section same for fleet. They can also add individuals.
