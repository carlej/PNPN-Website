time lock still has one exploit if they prep a transaction when they still have access they will be able to submit it after their shift ends it will still track that they make this transaction though


for land grant stuff

be able to check the ballance of accounts to see if they have enough to pay their due
add withdraw function so that the land steward can withdraw the amount from their account with the note that its for land grant

add a lock so that only people that are part of a land grant can register for volunteering shifts

use the land grand tab of charter table to turn this on and off. have one that has a null set for part tab if that one has land grant true then allow everyone to register for volunteering shifts

use question tab of users table to track if someone is part of a land grant to allow for less database pings


the land steward will use the charter table part tab to track who is part of a land grant. If they say to add a ship to a particular land grant it will add the entire crew section same for fleet. They can also add individuals.


add in an export function to pull up all the shifts in case of internet outage

for this make a new simple page that when you go to the page it will pull everything from the data base and throw everything into a file
It then has a download button that will then download the file that it just made.
use file_put_contents('file.txt', 'bar'); to put the info into the file using this will delete everything in the file and replace it with the new stuff.
use this for the first place at least to overwite the revious file
