to reset the auto incrument delete all the avalable jobs then turn on then off the auto incrument
then it will be back to 1
ALTER TABLE `jobs` CHANGE `ID` `ID` INT(6) UNSIGNED NOT NULL; turn off command

clear table command
DELETE FROM `jobs`;



time lock still has one exploit if they prep a transaction when they still have access they will be able to submit it after their shift ends it will still track that they make this transaction though


for land grant stuff

be able to check the ballance of accounts to see if they have enough to pay their due
add withdraw function so that the land steward can withdraw the amount from their account with the note that its for land grant

add a lock so that only people that are part of a land grant can register for volunteering shifts

use the land grand tab of charter table to turn this on and off. have one that has a null set for part tab if that one has land grant true then allow everyone to register for volunteering shifts

use question tab of users table to track if someone is part of a land grant to allow for less database pings


the land steward will use the charter table part tab to track who is part of a land grant. If they say to add a ship to a particular land grant it will add the entire crew section same for fleet. They can also add individuals.
