						<p>We welcome you to the Events operated by Pacific Northwest Pirate Nation, collectively referred to as “The Nation of Nassau”, or “Nassau”. As this is by no means a legally defined name, variations and flourished versions of the name are often used in-game. These events are a unique place where participants are invited to join an ongoing role-play world based largely on a romanticized fantasy version of the Golden Age of Piracy.</p>
						<p>While we are not a full LARP (Live Action Roleplay), neither are we strict historical re-enactors, and we enjoy a certain freedom with many additional elements deemed fitting to the overall experience, which do not break immersion, nor detract from the broad spectrum of what is generally considered part of the fantasy “pirate” world. We are a community where mutual respect has always been intended as the basis for interactions within our boundaries. As such, it is necessary to have clear and thorough rules so that all attendees, new or returning, can easily understand what is expected and allowed at our events.</p>
						<p>Put simply, rules are often restricting, and rulebooks can be confusing. Often there is an idea that is written which seems clear and simple enough to the author, but the reader may not immediately understand the intent or full context. We acknowledge that it is impossible to foresee every possible situation and variable, and therefor may leave out some rule or guideline which would settle the matter. There may be areas which are missed, due to lack of omniscience. And while we are not always as strict about some of our rules as some re-enactment or LARP communities are, clarity and transparency mandate that we make clear what we expect or desire from our participants. We ask that you please keep that in mind when reading these rules, and consider these basic ideas:</p>
						<p>&#x2022; Our events require cooperation, honor, and fair play in order to ensure the most fun for all participants. No one enjoys a game where one of the players refuses to play by the same rules as everyone else. Please read the rules thoroughly. The more familiar they are to you, the better equipped you will be to resolve situations that are not explicitly written.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; While parts of this rulebook (or Codex) are very detailed, we have tried to include sections that provide a simplified explanation. This will aid in your first read through, as well as those just looking to get a quick overview so they can jump in. You will find these examples in many sections, which help to understand how the rule applies.</p>
						<p>Examples will be contained in boxes to help them stand out.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; If something is ambiguous, it is important to use common sense. When trying to determine how to handle an unclear situation, please consider the following, in order: </p>
						<p style="margin-left: 1em">&#x2023; Consent of the parties involved</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 1em">&#x2023; Safety, both personal and of others</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 1em">&#x2023; Appropriateness of those in proximity, such as minors</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 1em">&#x2023; Fairness to all parties</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 1em">&#x2023; Immersion</p>
						<p>Anything which violates a higher-level consideration in order to suit a lower level is unacceptable.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; All structures of rank or title are purely voluntary, as there is no real-world legal authority given to these ranks and titles, but refusal to honor them and “play along” will result in a loss of immersion for others. If you choose not to play along, that is your choice. You are welcome to leave the event at any time. What you are not welcome to do, is to refuse to acknowledge our immersive systems and remain within the event.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; Please read the rules in their entirety. Some rules may seem to say one thing when taken out of context but may be revealed to be something different when full context is considered.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; If a term is used within the event that is not explicitly defined in this Rulebook, the commonly accepted definition of the term should be applied.</p>
						<p>When in doubt, be courteous and respectful, and always ensure consent, safety, and fairness of all involved. There are bound to be interactions between participants which were not imagined nor considered by the authors of this rulebook. If those interactions are unclear, please refer to the guides above to determine the best resolution for the situation in the most immersive and equitable way possible until an official ruling can be made.</p>
						<p>All this said, have fun! Enjoy! There are a plethora options and possibilities within our events. Try something new. Try something different. Don’t be afraid to experiment, but also do not feel pressured into stepping out of your comfort zone.</p>
						<p>Your level of participation is always up to you.</p>

						<p><a href="#SCOPE">&#x2022; GLOSSARY</a></p>
						<p id="SCOPE" style="font-size: 1.5em">SCOPE AND JURISDICTION</p>
						<p>This Codex (rulebook) applies to any and all events facilitated by Pacific Northwest Pirate Nation (PNPN), a registered Non-Profit corporation in the state of Oregon. At present, this includes (but is not limited to) the events owned by Legacy Bay Events, which are “Port Nassau: A SeaDog’s Refuge”, “Port Nassau: Tortuga Nights”, “Roast of Tortuga”, and “Port in the Storm”. These Role Play policies, unless specifically noted, apply to all such events, and to any future events created by Legacy Bay or operated by Pacific Northwest Pirate Nation.</p>
						<p id="VALUES" style="font-size: 1.5em">OUR VALUES</p>
						<p>As our events and our community grow and expand, it becomes important and necessary to think about the values which define us in our collective role-play experience. We count on you, the participants, to share and apply these within the community because you are the guardians of our pirate nation.</p>
						<p id="Cooperation"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Cooperation</u></p>
						<p>We are all part of a recognized and established community that includes different groups and individuals. The community is driven by support, safety, and integration. Participants must be able to rely on each other when needed. While in-game role-play rivalries, competition, and conflict are both welcome and encouraged, participants should avoid anything which might harm, upset, or inconvenience other participants out of game. Conflict within the game should never escalate to out of game physical violence. If you’re uncertain whether something qualifies as inappropriate behavior, you should avoid doing it.</p>
						<p id="Ethics"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Game Ethics</u></p>
						<p>Each event is a recreational activity that requires fair-play and the respect of various rules. Whether it be during contests, daily activities within the virtual game, “combat” activities, or under any other form, participants must respect the rules of the game and their essence. If you are acting in a way which infringes upon other participants’ ability to have fun, then you are not playing in the spirit of the game. This includes, but is not limited to, role play that disrupts official event activities and games, or seeks to undermine the staff’s ability to run official activities and games. If you have an idea that involves changing or replacing a certain official activity, contest, or game, there is a proper method (detailed later) to bring that suggestion to the producers of the event.</p>
						<p id="Involvement"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Involvement</u></p>
						<p>The creative effort put forward by participants enriches each event. It is important that participants continue to be involved and put their person, their ideas, and their artistic endeavors to the service of a common objective: refining and improving the game. We encourage all participants to be as creative and free with their characters and affiliations, within the scope of the official game, as they please.</p>
						<p id="Inclusion"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Inclusion</u></p>
						<p>Since participants that partake in each event’s activities are involved in a process that directly influences their experience, elements of personal distinction cannot be used to discriminate against them. PNPN has a strict anti-discrimination policy, and role-play elements shall never be used as an excuse to violate it. Everyone is welcome regardless of sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, body size, disability or physical limitations, race, ethnicity, religious choices (or lack of), or age (other than specific event limits on minors).</p>
						<p id="Respect"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Respect</u></p>
						<p>Role-playing is not an excuse for neglecting the well-being of other participants. We are all responsible for the well-being of everyone who participates in the event’s activities. Respect for consent, personal boundaries, and the rules must coexist with the right to celebrate. Each participant has the right to the respect of his/her/their physical, psychological, and moral integrity, whether it be in-game or not.</p>
						<p id="Tidiness"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Tidiness</u></p>
						<p>While at events, the responsibility for the cleanliness of the site, both in private camps and in public areas, is a shared responsibility for all participants. All trash and debris are to be disposed of in appropriate receptacles, and in designated areas. The spirit of immersion is best enjoyed when there are not hazards of waste lying about, and continuation of site use is contingent upon how we as a group leave it. The Trash Warden demands sacrifice be paid by all in the form of refuse and rubbish, but only in the areas declared for such purpose. Failure to do so may incur the wrath of the Sovereign Nation of Ye Ol’ Trash Heap.</p>
						<p id="Responsibility"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Civic Responsibility</u></p>
						<p>The reality of life at each event must always be considered. It is every participant’s duty to encourage proper conduct and to report violations. Participants must do more than simply denounce inappropriate behavior; they must also adopt attitudes that promote respect and preserve harmony within the community. Under no circumstances may a participant violate local, state, or federal laws. Any policy or rule of the event which is grounded in local, state, or federal law is not to be disputed within the event itself, nor with staff (including volunteers) of the event.</p>
						<p id="STYLINGS" style="font-size: 1.5em">VISUAL STYLINGS</p>
						<p id="Garb"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Garb</u></p>
						<p>Within our events, we ask that ALL attendees make a reasonable attempt to dress in a manner befitting the Fantasy Pirate theme. While this is primarily based on 18th Century fashion found in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, we welcome many different styles and themes that complement the idea of ahistorical Fantasy. Most pre-20th Century clothing, and manners of dress from around the world, as well as fictionalized versions (including but not limited to Steampunk and other anachronistic styles) are welcome, as are those based on Mythology, Folklore, and romanticized history.</p>
						<p>The primary goal is that we ask that attendees not dress in clearly modern, nor futuristic clothing (even if it is allegedly from an ancient setting in fiction).</p>
						<p>Example: Garb which resembles a costume found in Pirates of the Caribbean, Treasure Planet, or even Lord of the Rings are all perfectly suitable, but costumes from Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, etc., are discouraged.</p>
						<p id="Camping"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Tents and Camping</u></p>
						<p>We do not have requirements for tents and other camping shelters like many re-enactment groups. We understand that budget is a consideration for many. We do though highly encourage methods of either disguising or hiding clearly modern tents and there are many resources available for those who wish to learn. Tall panels around encampments can help hide clearly modern tents and can be easily decorated to add to the aesthetics of a camp. Covering battery lanterns with paper lantern surrounds can help disguise them. LED candles add ambiance to a camp, while not creating a fire hazard. There are many “flicker-flame” electric lights available now which add to the general immersion, as opposed to clearly modern battery powered electric lights. As with Garb, the intent is to “feel” Fantasy Pirate (and Pirate Adjacent), without the need to adhere to strict historically accurate methods.</p>
						<p id="Ships"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Ships</u></p>
						<p>While there is no requirement to have a “ship” to attend events within Nassau, the Fantasy Pirate Theme is greatly enhanced by those who do. Many groups set up mock ships that resemble wooden sailing ships, or the remnants of them. We do ask that anyone who desires to construct a ship do so with the same guiding principles as Garb, that they fit the immersive theme of the event and not be clearly modern nor futuristic.</p>
						<p id="Flags"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Flags</u></p>
						<p>What’s a pirate ship without a pirate flag? Flags are always welcome and encouraged, including those which display the markings used by real world historical pirates. Custom flags are encouraged as they add to the general appeal of the event. Modern national flags are allowable, though not entirely within the theme.</p>
						<p id="Offensive"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Offensive Imagery</u></p>
						<p>No imagery that promotes, nor resembles, any movement (political or otherwise) which espouses hate, intolerance, nor injustice to marginalized communities in the real world is allowed. Nassau is an inclusive event, and anyone found displaying such imagery may be asked to remove it, leave the event, or possibly even may be banned from events, at the discretion of the Producers.</p>
						<p id="PERSONA" style="font-size: 1.5em">PERSONA NAMING AND HONORIFICS</p>
						<p id="Character"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Character</u></p>
						<p>Each participant of PNPN’s events is encouraged to create a character, or persona, for themselves that differs from their real-life, mundane self. Some characters are very different, and some may only be slightly different. The degree of differentiation between a participant and their character is up to each participant. The key is to have fun, so no one should ever feel forced to create a specific type of character persona, nor feel shamed or embarrassed for having a character persona which is not all that dissimilar to their mundane self.</p>
						<p id="Naming"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Naming</u></p>
						<p>Commonly referred to as “pirate name”, “persona name”, or “character name”, each participant is encouraged to create a name for their event character that helps distinguish their in-game persona from their mundane self. Naming is often one of the trickiest tasks for some people, and some participants may choose to use a name that is very similar to their mundane name. While this is acceptable, it can lead to confusion when someone is trying to refer a character versus an actual person.</p>
						<p>Example: A person’s mundane name might be Bartholomew Roberts, and his character name might be Bart. But if he goes by Bart in the mundane world, it’s hard to distinguish if someone else is speaking about him or his character.</p>
						<p>Names often can include nicknames or monikers as was a common practice during the Golden Age of Piracy. Many participants say that nicknames and monikers are best earned, not chosen (and some ships and camps adhere to this as an internal rule), however it is up to each participant to use or not use them as they wish.</p>
						<p>Example: Edward Teach was commonly referred to as “Blackbeard”. Johnathan (Jack) Rackham was referred to as “Calico Jack” Rackham.</p>
						<p>In keeping with the spirit of being a historically based LARP, names that aren’t really “names” are discouraged (though not explicitly disallowed). A name should sound like something a parent would name their child, even though later nicknames and monikers might be added.</p>
						<p>Example: It is unlikely that parents would have named their child “Black Bart”. But a character named Bartholomew Roberts, who later earns (or chooses) the moniker Black Bart is in keeping with the spirit of immersion.</p>
						<p>Some people might wish to add certain flourishes to their name. Often, flourishes are earned by way of a specific deed or position within the game, however some flourishes are acceptable to use if they do not violate the naming policy.</p>
						<p>Example: Benjamin Hornigold, the Widowmaker is acceptable so long as “the Widowmaker” is not a title nor honorific currently awarded by any official game, contest, or activity within the Nation of Nassau.</p>
						<p>Names that include, or are accompanied, by an element that resembles a title have specific rules governing their use.</p>
						<p>Names which include offensive language are not strictly prohibited but may be problematic when used around minors. Please be mindful. Some names may be deemed so offensive due to context or meaning that they may not be allowed, but this will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Producers.</p>
						<p id="Presumption"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Titles of Presumption</u></p>
						<p>Presumption is a false claim. This includes claims of restricted rank or powers that the participant does not possess within the Nation of Nassau or that we do not allow anyone to claim. It also includes claims of identity or close relationship with a person outside of PNPN’s events who is considered important by many people within and outside the Nation. Presumption is not dependent on intent; even if such a claim was not intended, the appearance of a claim is not allowed.</p>
						<p>Example: Even though Nassau does not currently have a King or Queen, because The Nation of Nassau acknowledges monarchs of the SCA, ROC, SeaDog Nation, and other groups which grant use of those titles, no one may declare themselves a King or Queen, even of a fictionalized nation, and use it within their Name, Moniker or Flourishes.</p>
						<p id="Rank"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Claim to Rank</u></p>
						<p>Names, nicknames, monikers, and flourishes may not contain a claim to a protected and/or restricted rank or title that the participant does not possess within the Nation, but which are in use within Nassau, are listed as forbidden titles/ranks within Nassau, or are protected/restricted ranks and titles granted by other re-enactment or LARP groups which Nassau has recognized as “Visiting Dignitaries and Persons of Acclaim”.</p>
						<p>Example: Winners of the “Defender of Nassau” competition are granted the rank of “Commander”. No one other than those specifically granted use of this rank may use this as a rank, nor as part of their Name, Moniker, or Flourishes.</p>
						<p id="Award"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Rank without Award</u></p>
						<p>Certain ranks within Nassau are allowed for use by meeting specific conditions, without the need for the participant to be awarded the title by way of contest, competition, or game. These are ranks which were commonly held onboard ship or within households and are governed by those within each group to use as they deem appropriate. We ask that anyone who chooses to use these ranks and titles do so within the spirit of immersion.</p>
						<p>Example: Captain was not just a military title but is what the person at the highest level of command of a ship was called. Participants may use “Captain” as a rank so long as they have a crew of appropriate size who follow them and acknowledge them as the Captain. A person camping by themselves may call themselves “Captain”, but without a crew this does not fit the spirit of the title, nor would having a crew full of Captains.</p>
						<p>A list of commonly held shipboard ranks, household titles, and other official titles and ranks will be maintained in the Registry of the Lists, with copies available at Scuttlebutt and on the Port Nassau website.</p>
						<p>Example: Common shipboard ranks and titles, such as Quartermaster, Boatswain (Bosun), First Mate, etc. are allowed for use by crews as that crew sees fit.</p>
						<p>The use of any rank or title not covered on the Registry of the Lists is not expressly forbidden but does not guarantee recognition nor honors within Nassau. Clear attempts to deceive the community with use of titles or ranks in a way which appears to indicate that they are “official”, holding station or privilege within the Nation, will be held as infractions as covered by Presumption and possibly subject to board review of your conduct if deemed malicious in nature and/or disruptive to the community at large.</p>
						<p id="ROLE-PLAYING" style="font-size: 1.5em">ROLE-PLAYING PIRACY</p>
						<p>As a Romanticized Fantasy Pirate event, with LARP elements, it is expected that participants will desire to engage in acts of piracy, such as “stealing” of items, holding property or people for ransom, and other generally accepted pirate style acts. Even those whose character is not necessarily a “pirate” may wish to engage in this style of game play. These “Shenanigans” are highly encouraged in the spirit of enhancing the immersion and fun of the event, but it should always be remembered that a game is only fun when everyone follows the same rules, and when everyone actually wants to play. Should any camp not want to participate in role-play Shenanigans, that must be respected at all times.</p>
						<p id="Larceny"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Larceny</u></p>
						<p>The act of taking an item from another Camp, within the rules of the event, is hereby termed “Larceny” in-game.</p>
						<p>While visiting any Camp, it is forbidden to remove, conceal, or otherwise attempt to claim ANY property for any reason which is not owned by you or a Camp you represent, other than properly designated “In-Game” items. This includes items that you wish to ransom, use for bribery or trade, or other styles of shenanigans. Theft is theft and will not be tolerated, even when under the claim of role-play.</p>
						<p>Items within the Merchant Area, or Staff structures, are NEVER considered “in game” and any theft from merchants or staff will NOT be tolerated.</p>
						<p>Larceny from another Camp is permitted any time the publicly accessible areas of the Camp are “open” to visitors starting immediately following Opening Court and concluding at the start of Closing Court. During this time period, all In-Game items, such as Flags and Artifacts, should be kept in a location which allows for the possibility of Larceny.</p>
						<p>Example: Keeping an Artifact in your personal tent, or “below decks” during the daytime is considered bad-faith gameplay. This is not an area where you would allow visitors and therefor it removes the possibility of proper Larceny by game rules.</p>
						<p>Camps may “secure” their Colours and Artifacts when they go dark for the night. When they have extinguished all lights in the public areas and are no longer allowing visitors on board, they have “gone dark”. The intent is to keep items in play as much as possible but allow for Camps to actually get some sleep without a guard being posted all night.</p>
						<p>Larceny is ALWAYS an opt-in style system, and no Camp will be forced to play should they choose not to.</p>
						<p id="Items"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">In-Game Items</u></p>
						<p>Colours: Any flag displayed by a Ship, Household, or other Camp, bearing its symbol, is considered “In-Game” and may be the target of Larceny. Ransom MUST be offered, and no flag may be taken if something must be cut, broken, or physically modified in order to get it. Any flag taken MUST be returned in exactly the same condition it was before being taken. Any camp which has its colours secured with something which must be cut, broken, or otherwise physically modified has NOT opted-in to the Larceny game.</p>
						<p>Sterlings: All Sterlings are considered in game, as these are Role Play currency with no real world value. If Sterlings are out in the open, especially unattended, they are fair game. Leaving Sterlings laying about is a good way to get them stolen. No one is authorized to enter any “non public” area, open any container, or otherwise “go into” something to get Sterlings, however.</p>
						<p>Example: Charles Vane carries his Sterlings in a pouch on his belt. It is not allowed to open his pouch and “pick pocket” him for his Sterlings. But if Charles should set a pile of Sterlings on a table to count them and then leave the table and visit the bar, his unattended Sterlings are up for the taking.</p>
						<p>Artifacts: Any Artifact may be the target of Larceny. Artifacts are typically held but requesting Ransom for their return is allowable. Any Artifact held by a Camp MUST be kept in a publicly accessible area of the Camp, in order to give other Participants a chance to commit Larceny of them. Possessing an Artifact qualifies as making the choice to opt-in to the Larceny game.</p>
						<p>Game Tokens: Any item specifically designed for an independent game as one of that game’s tokens. These items MUST conform to the rules of that game and be known as tokens within that game. Only participants who are engaged in that game, and known to its facilitators, can take a token of that game from another Camp.</p>
						<p>Example: The Thieves’ Guild maintains their own game in which players try to “steal” tokens from each other in a competition. These tokens are designed specifically for their game and are publicized and marked.</p>
						<p>Specific agreements between Camps MAY allow for Larceny on pre-agreed terms, so long as it does not violate any other event rules. No one should EVER presume an agreement exists, and if it is uncertain, every participant must follow event rules as though no agreement exists.</p>
						<p>Camps which have friendly rapport between them might agree that certain items can be taken by the other camp in the name of fun. This agreement must be agreed to openly and known to all members of both Camps. Camps which agree to playing this way will NOT be held as violating the event rules, even though technically not following them, though if either Camp wishes to end the agreement, that must be honored by the other Camp immediately. This should never be considered as officially endorsed but is an allowable exception that will be acknowledged should a third party witness an act and report it unknowingly.</p>
						<p id="Abandoned"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Holding Abandoned Property for Ransom</u></p>
						<p>If a participant leaves an item of theirs in another Camp which they are not a member of, it may be considered “Abandoned” for purposes of game play. In order to be properly considered Abandoned, the owner must have completely left the boundaries of the camp, and the item may not have been concealed from its owner while they were still in the camp. It is then permissible for that Camp to hold that Abandoned item for Ransom. A Ransom Note MUST be delivered to the owner as quickly as able, and the item cannot be “hidden” from the owner if they return to claim it.</p>
						<p>Example: If Charles Vane leaves his hat sitting on the bar of the Queen Anne’s Revenge (a ship which he is not a crew member of), and then later returns seeking it, the crew of the QAR is not allowed to say “no, we don’t have it.” They must state that they do have it, and then present terms for its return.</p>
						<p>Any and all items which were claimed as Abandoned and held for Ransom MUST be turned into Lost and Found immediately following Closing Court if arrangements have not been made with the proper owner for their return prior to the conclusion of Court.</p>
						<p id="Hostages"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Hostages</u></p>
						<p>Certain participants within the community hold positions of note which make them valuable targets within the roleplay game. Those holding titles of nobility or station are often found to be the target of pirates seeking to claim a Ransom, as might Captains or Officers of rival camps. The process of claiming a Hostage shall involve speaking plainly to the desired target and stating to them “You are my Hostage”. This may be done loudly or whispered in close proximity to them. Hostages will always be treated with absolute dignity and respect while being held and shall retain the right to refrain from roleplay.</p>
						<p>Example: Jack Rackham may see Prince John sitting at a party, without escort or guards. Jack approaches Prince John unchallenged, produces his pistol which he brandishes to Prince John, and declares the Prince his Hostage. If no one nearby should challenge this, then Prince John will accompany Jack back to Rackham’s Camp to await Ransom.</p>
						<p>rmed resistance may be used to repel the attempt to claim a hostage, following the approved Methods of Combat, and ANY participant who is involved in an activity which they cannot remove themselves from may state that they must remain where they are until the conclusion of such activity.</p>
						<p>Example: Jack Rackham approaches Prince John, produces his pistol, and John’s guards immediately draw swords to repel the Hostage attempt. Jack has accompanying men with him, and they best the guards. Prince John is then claimed as a Hostage.</p>
						<p>Once claimed a Hostage, the captor must escort the Hostage back to their Camp, where they are required to provide the Hostage with a comfortable place to sit, shade from the sun, and water. After dark, Hostages must be seated in a well-lit area and care should be made to ensure they are warm enough. Should they wish to provide the Hostage with more accommodations, such as drinks and food, that is their prerogative. Hostages, while valuable targets in the sense of roleplay, are to be considered your guest at all times. Ransom MUST be demanded at the time the Hostage is taken, should other crew of theirs be present, or delivered to their Camp immediately.</p>
						<p>Any who does not Consent to being taken Hostage has that right. It may seem like it is not in the spirit of fair gameplay, but personal Consent is ALWAYS required. It is advised to not engage in attempting to claim a Hostage with people who are unfamiliar with you or at times when the target is clearly engaged in an activity they cannot depart from.</p>
						<p id="Ransom"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Ransom</u></p>
						<p>Any time a Hostage is taken, Abandoned Property is held, or Larceny of the Colours is committed, it is mandatory to leave a Ransom Note at the scene in plain view, or promptly deliver one to an officer or leader of the Ship, House, or Camp affected, or to the person whose Property was Abandoned. A proper Ransom Note must make clear four things:</p>
						<p>&#x2022; WHAT: What is the Ransom for? If a Hostage was taken, who it was. If it’s property, what the property is, including where it was left if it is Abandoned Property.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; WHO: Who is the Ransom due to.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; WHERE: Where must the Ransom payer go to conduct the paying and retrieval.</p>
						<p>&#x2022; HOW: How shall the Ransom be paid? Ransoms must be kept reasonable.</p>
						<p>Notes should be clear and easy to understand, though immersive language and simple riddles are acceptable. The objective is to keep it fun, and interesting, for everyone involved.</p>
						<p id="Capture"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Capture</u></p>
						<p>Any Ship, Household, or other Camp which displays the Colours is a potential target for Capture. Capture is one of the more skilled forms of Shenanigans and can lead to interesting role-play when successful. Capture occurs when the crew of one Camp is able to display their Colours above or more prominently than the Colours of the Camp they are capturing. The Colours of the Captors must remain flying, uncontested, for a reasonable amount of time. Any Camp which is Captured during dark hours must be undisturbed by the Captors, who are still bound by limits of public and private encampment. The Captors must then return during daylight hours, no earlier than 8am, to make their claim. If the Colours which they flew remain in the place, the target is considered Captured, and Ransom (or other Terms) may be presented. Capture may also be the result of a successful Raid.</p>
						<p>Example: Black Bart and some cohorts sneak onto the deck of the Queen Anne’s Revenge while the crew of QAR is playing Norse Stickball. They lower the QAR’s flag and place their own flag above it, then hoist it back up. (They may also take the QAR’s flag in exchange if it is a valid Larceny target). They then leave the deck and wait until dinner time, when they return and announce that they have captured the QAR, pointing out their flags which still remains flying on the QAR’s mast.</p>
						<p id="Raids"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Raids</u></p>
						<p>Crews may wish to engage in the Raiding of other Camps, for the purpose of Larceny of an Artifact, taking a Hostage, or Capture of the Camp itself. Raids shall be conducted using the approved Methods of Combat, and only during daylight hours, but no earlier than 9am. Raids after dark may not be in the form of an aggressive battle, but only an Boarding Party (due to safety of low-light conditions). Raids may never be made on a Camp which is “closed” for some private event (such as a wedding) or once the public area of the Camp is dark and closed to visitors. As a matter of etiquette, it is best to verify that a Camp is able to fight off a raid before using an aggressive raid, when an armed boarding party could accomplish the same task.</p>
						<p id="Boarding"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Boarding Party</u></p>
						<p>Similar to a Raid, a Boarding Party is one which approaches another Camp while armed and states their intent to board. Should the Camp not be prepared to repel a raid, a Boarding Party may enter the public area of the Camp, state their intent (Larceny of an Artifact, taking a Hostage, etc.) and then make demands. Boarding Parties must only be armed per the approved Methods of Combat, and only during daylight hours and open nighttime hours.</p>
						<p>Example: The crew of Queen Anne’s Revenge approach the Ranger. They see only one crewmember of the Ranger aboard, and they state they are boarding. There is no armed resistance to this, and so the QAR crew boards the Ranger in order to seize the Artifact kept on the Ranger’s bar.</p>
						<p id="Limits"><u style="font-size: 1.5em">Off Limits</u></p>
						<p>Merchant’s Row is off limits for games which involve Larceny and Ransom, whether official or not. Anyone found removing any property not legally theirs from a Merchant tent will be considered as committing theft. Likewise, Merchants are strictly forbidden from possessing and displaying any in-game tokens or Artifacts within their merchant tent to avoid confusion about this rule.</p>
						<p>Any and all facilities, structures, and equipment used by event staff to conduct event related business, including but not limited to official games, contests, participant assistance, et al are strictly off limits to Larceny, claimed as Abandoned and held for Ransom, Raids, or other role-play Shenanigans. If event equipment is accidentally left in a Camp, it is to be IMMEDIATELY turned in to Gate or Scuttlebutt. Any personal items which are not regarded as event equipment but are found in an event structure are to be promptly turned in to Lost and Found.</p>
						<p>Violation of Off-Limits areas may be handled as possible theft by the Producers of the event.</p>
